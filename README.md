# My Jemdoc Site
Easy and Simple.

Using [Jemdoc](http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/) allows this website to be generated fast and easy. 

The Travis automation allows all the static web pages to be generated when the Jemdoc code is pushed.

Finally Travis also allows the static pages to be deployed to the Azure storage account that hosts the pages over Azure CDN.

This means one commit and push is all that needs to be done to update the website. The only pesky part is how slow CDN is to update. Oh well...
